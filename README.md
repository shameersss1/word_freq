Algorithm Used:

1) Read the file from server line by line using fopen() function
2) using ' '(Space) as a delimiter segregatted words from the file
3) Using hashmap to create (key,value) pair for each unique words ie key = unique words , value = count of those words
4) sorted the hashmap according to the value;
5) print the top n values among them


Note: for a dynamic file use of heap data structure would have been the best option since it is a static i have used hashmap + sorting technique.
